# `Scer_YOL_3genes_w_30utrs_annotation_provenance.txt`

Transcript sequences:

`Scer_YOL_3genes_w_30utrs.fa`

Coding sequence locations:

`Scer_YOL_3genes_w_30utrs.gff3`

These annotations were created by selecting data from 3 genes (YOL012C, YOL039W, YOL086C) from files in the folder `fungi/saccharomyces/annotation` and basing the files off of the first ~90 nucleotides.
* `Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_yeast_CDS_w_250utrs.fa`
* `Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_yeast_CDS_w_250utrs.gff3`

Provenenance of those files is described in `Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_yeast_CDS_w_250utrs_annotation_provenance.txt`
